# [u/DoAnAnalysis](https://reddit.com/u/DoAnAnalysis/)
The knowledgebase of the "DoAnAnalysis" Reddit bot.

This bot contains information about subreddits. The information is hand-written by maintainers of this bot & contributors, and added to the `daa-knowledge-base.json` file.

The bot listens to the phrase "DoAnAnalysis" over Reddit (in `r/all`). If it registered the phrase, it finds out at what subreddit it's located. If the subreddit is in it's database, he replies with information about that subreddit. If not, default description of the subreddit (chosen by mods) is provided.

*This bot is a side-project by me, and my first Reddit bot ever. It is experimental, and contains dumb source code. It should not be taken seriously, however I'm waiting until it gets taken down. 

Source code is located in `source-code.js`.

##### Currently, we have to fight weird rate-limits. Poor bot, needs more karma.
