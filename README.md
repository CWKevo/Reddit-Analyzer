# [u/CW_Analyzer](https://reddit.com/u/CW_Analyzer/)
The knowledgebase of the "CW_Analyzer" Reddit bot.

This bot contains information about subreddits. The information is hand-written by maintainers of this bot & contributors, and added to the `daa-knowledge-base.json` file.

The bot listens to itself being mentioned. If it registered the mention, it finds out at what subreddit it's located. If the subreddit is in it's database, he replies with information about that subreddit.

*This bot is a side-project by me, and my first Reddit bot ever. It is experimental, and contains dumb source code. It should not be taken seriously, however I'm waiting until it gets taken down.*

Source code is located in `source-code.js`.
